# Fighter-Jets
Move around with arrows F to fire missile Very glitchy LOL  This is the first version, so it might be kinda laggy. Try to get in front of the other player and shoot them from there. Space to do a barrel roll. Ps. If you press space and fire at the same time, it makes it spawn more jets, so please don't do that. Don't touch the bottom, or you will lose.
